# OpenBus

Open Bus is a project of [The Public Knowledge Workshop](http://http://www.hasadna.org.il). 

We use public data to improve bus service - and public transport in general - in Israel.

We currently work on two sub-projects: Real Delays and Bus2Train. In addition, we have side tasks cropping up from time to time, [see our issues](<https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/issues>).

## Real Delays
Aggregating real-time bus data and comparing it to the planned bus schedules. The Ministry of Transport publishes both static (planned)  and real-time (actual) trip data. We are working on aggregating data that will allow analysis of bus delays and canceled trips. 


## Bus2Train
Analyze bus service to and from train stations. This is a data analysis task that uses (for now) GTFS static data.
