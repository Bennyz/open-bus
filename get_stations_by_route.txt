This draft file outlines the relationships between the relevant GTFS files / tables
to determine how to extract the list of stops for a given route + departure stop.

input: route + departure stop
output: list of stops

routes.route_id = trips.route_id
trips.trip_id = stop_times.trip_id
stop_times.stop_id = stops.stop_id

routes -> trips -> stop_times -> stops
